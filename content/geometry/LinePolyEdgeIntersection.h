 * Description:  For use in computing line-polygon intersection between some line s-e and polygon side p1-p2. 
 *               To use, apply this function to all polygon edges, sort outputs by first key and maintain running sum of second key. 
 *               Segments for which the running sum was nonzero are in the intersection.
